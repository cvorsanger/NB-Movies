This is my Statistics II Class Final Project.

In it I build a Naive Bayes classifier to predict movie genres from their plot. 

A simple Bag of Words approch was taken to handle the plot information. The words were tokenized, stemmed, and stopwords were removed before feeding the BOW to the Naive Bayes Classifier.

18 different genres were investigated.

Data was taken from MovieLens (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and from IMDb using IMDbpy (https://imdbpy.github.io/). Final data was collected and stored in Final.csv
